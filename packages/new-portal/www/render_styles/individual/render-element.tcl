# DRB: With the creation of the accessible Zen theme, portlets are numbered for the
# convenience of reading devices.  The numbering is done by the layout template.  Since
# old layouts (in particular custom ones not part of the standard .LRN release)
# don't number portlets, we check and set a dummy value if it doesn't exist.

# DRB: We're not actually using these numbers after all.  However, the works done, it
# doesn't hurt anything to keep this code, so in case someone wants to number portlets
# in the future, the code's already here (trust me, it ain't all that easy to figure out
# how to do this)
