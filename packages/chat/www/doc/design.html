<h3>
II. Introduction</h3>
We have our own chat server because:
<ul>
<li>
We want to allow our users to participate in instant message communications
with other community members.</li>

<li>
We want our system to be integrated.</li>

<li>
We want to use our own internal permissioning system to more securely determine
who can enter, create or delete rooms that would be possible using an external
security system.</li>

<li>
We want something that can be extended and maintained by any ArsDigita
programmer, <em>i.e.</em>, something that requires only AOLserver, Tcl, Oracle,
and Java skills.</li>

<li>
Commercial chat servers tend to be expensive to maintain and will require
a separate community data model.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
III. Historical Considerations</h3>
Chat applications allow inexpensive and efficient social interactions between
community members spread across the globe.&nbsp; A community can use the
Chat application&nbsp; to allow its members to have an interactive session
with a special guest or a community member through the means of a moderated
chat. A customer support site can use the Chat application to offer instant
responses to its customers regarding its products.
<h3>
IV. Competitive Analysis</h3>

<h4>
<a href="http://www.aim.aol.com/">AOL Instant Messenger (AIM)</a></h4>
So why can't companies that want to do 1:1 conversations just use AIM?&nbsp;
AOL Instant Messenger works best with some additional software to be installed
on the user's machine. This is free software, is shipped with Netscape
4.x, and is certainly available to AOL service customers. But it is not
universal and you can't be guaranteed that when someone is connecting to
your Web site they have the AIM client.&nbsp; Furthermore, AIM doesn't
has a logging option, thus there is no way for a site to offer a chat transcript
to its members.
<h4>
<a href="http://chat.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Chat</a></h4>
Yahoo offers its members a wide range of services including chat. Their
chat supports both HTML and Java applet clients. Unfortunately, their chat
software is proprietary, so companies cannot incorporate their community
model with Yahoo's chat software.
<h4>
<a href="http://www.digichat.com/">DigiChat</a></h4>
DigiChat is a standalone Java chat application. It offers a well thought
out chat client interface and also supports moderated chats. However like
most third party applications, there are no easy means by which Digichat
can be integrated with a site's preexisting user data model.&nbsp; DigiChat
also comes with a heavy price tag, and as such it might not be suitable
for a small communities that need to support chat sessions.
<p>The ArsDigita Java Chat application does not have a pretty client interface,
nor does it support text formating like Yahoo and Digichat.&nbsp; However,
our Chat application is open source.&nbsp; As such, any competent Java
developer will be able to improve the interface based upon their or their
employer's preferences. Using the ArsDigita Chat application allows site
developers access to a rich community data model which is compatible with
a variety of existing open-source applications.
<h3>
V. Design Tradeoffs</h3>

<h4>
Archive or not?</h4>
We have to drive the entire system design from a publishing decision: are
we interested in seeing archives of chat sessions? If we are, then archiving
into a single table makes a lot of sense.&nbsp;&nbsp; We can perform a
single SQL query to see everything that a user has contributed. We can
perform a single SQL query to see how a customer service person is doing.
And so on.
<p>A disadvantage of archiving is that it chews up disk space.&nbsp; Imagine
for a moment that your service is the size of America Online, wherein one
million subscribers chat or use AIM every day.&nbsp; Imagine also that
each person types 50 rows of chat/AIM content each of which requires 100
bytes of storage.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a scenario would require our table to
grow by 50 million rows and 5 GB each day. After 20 days, we would begin
to bump up against the billion-row table size that data warehouse experts
suggest as a practical limit.
<p>So it seems that on popular public sites we won't be able to store everything
that users type. At the same time, a customer's interaction with a customer
service person, or a special guest chat should be archived.&nbsp; Also,
many sites engage considerably less traffic than does AOL, and these sites
may benefit from being able to log all chat/AIM communications.
<p>The solution we came up with was to provide an option that allows the
creator of a room to decide whether or not to archive the messages.
<h4>
HTML vs. Applet</h4>
An advantage to using an HTML client as opposed to an applet-based client
is the ability to have rich graphical representations as a part of the
chat, such as color formating, in-line images rendered by the browser in
use, et cetera.&nbsp; Furthermore, users who are still using older non-Java
enabled browsers will be able to participate in the chat.&nbsp; A limitation
of the HTML client is that users cannot see messages in real time, as HTML
provides no auto-update functionality.
<p>By using a Java applet-based client, users can see messages updated
in real time. This is important in, e.g., a customer service setting.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Since SUN JDK 1.1 doesn't provides a text rendering API, applet-based clients
are limited in the format of the text that they can display. There are
also limitations on the server as to how many TCP sockets can be open at
the same time.&nbsp; Since each user using an applet-based chat client
will use one TCP socket, there could be a limit on how many user can use
the applet. This problem could be solved by employing customized hardware
more suitable for the task.&nbsp;
<p>Our system provides both a HTML and a Java applet-based chat client.&nbsp;
By providing each of these, we open up our Chat application to a broader
pool of users by offering users the chat method which will work best for
them.
<h4>
Java Servlet vs. Pure AOL server</h4>
Use of a Java servlet provides us with
<ul>
<li>
reduced development time,</li>

<li>
a large number of API provided by SUN, and</li>

<li>
portability,</li>
</ul>
however using a servlet requires a somewhat nonstandard (for ACS, that
is) installation method for the chat package, since the application
requires <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/">Jakarta-tomcat</a> and
nstomcat to be preinstalled and configure properly. These extra steps
are dificult and different on each platform.

<p>Using the AOL server socket API, there could be a performance
improvement and will not require installation of Jakarta-tomcat.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, AOL does not provide much by way of documentation
regarding AOL socket.  As of the current time, there are still major
features missing from the AOL socket API which would be required to
completely replace the Java/servlet method.

<p>Initially, I chose using a Java servlet as my development platform
due to time constraints. As development progressed, I analyzed the use
of the servlet in the current chat application.  Since the servlets
sole purpose is to provide communication between the HTML and the Java
applet clients, I concluded that this would be adequate for the present
purposes, and that the extra efforts required to set up Jakarta-tomcat
with AOL server would be unjustified.  After some experimentation, I
was able to rebuild the bridge between the HTML and the Java applet
clients using only AOL Server and the Java chat server.  As a resul,t the Chat
application may now be downloaded and installed just as any other ACS 4
applications may be.

<h4>Chat message protocol: Text base vs. Java serialize object</h4>
<p>In the earlier chat version, chat messages were broadcast to the
applet client Java serialize objects. The advantage of serialize
objects is that they make it easy to retrieve information.  The 
disadvantage of this method is the messages are limited to Java only.  

<p>To support clients from different programming language and not
limit our application to Java, I choose an XML text base for the chat
message protocol.

<h4>
Chat messages are stored in cache</h4>
Since we do not allow a user to view messages prior to his entrance into
the chat room, there is no need for time-consuming Oracle queries to retrieve
messages.&nbsp; Storing messages in the server cache keeps us from being
able to archive all of the messages from the time the server started.&nbsp;
I decided that I would limit the number of messages cached per room.
<h3>
VI. API</h3>

<h4>Chat message XML definition</h4>
<pre><code>
&lt;login&gt

   &lt;user_id&gt;&lt;/user_id&gt

   &lt;user_name&gt;&lt;/user_name&gt

   &lt;pw&gt;&lt;/pw&gt

   &lt;room_id&gt;&lt;/room_id&gt

&lt;/login&gt

</code></pre> After connection to the chat server, each client must
identify itself via a login message.  The chat server will disconnect
the client if the first message is not a proper login message or if the user
doesn't have proper permissions for the chat room.

<pre><code>
&lt;message&gt

   &lt;message_id&gt;&lt;/message_id&gt

   &lt;from_user_id&gt;&lt;/from_user_id&gt

   &lt;from&gt;&lt;/from&gt

   &lt;to_user_id&gt;&lt;/to_user_id&gt

   &lt;to&gt;&lt;/to&gt

   &lt;room_id&gt;&lt;/room_id&gt

   &lt;status&gt;approved | pending&lt;/status&gt

   &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt

&lt;/message&gt

</code></pre>

To construct a public message that will broadcast to everyone in the
chat room, the <em><strong>to_user_id</strong></em> and <em><strong>to</strong></em> fields
need to be excluded from the message. When these two fields are present in
the message then the message will only send to a specific
user. Sending private messages to HTML users is not yet supported.

<pre><code>
&lt;system&gt

   &lt;user_enter&gt

      &lt;user_id&gt;&lt;/user_id&gt

      &lt;user_name&gt;&lt;/user_name&gt

   &lt;/user_enter&gt

&lt;/system&gt


&lt;system&gt

   &lt;user_leave&gt

      &lt;user_id&gt;&lt;/user_id&gt

      &lt;user_name&gt;&lt;/user_name&gt

   &lt;/user_leave&gt

&lt;/system&gt

</code></pre>

Each time a client enters or exits the room, an appropriate message
will be broadcast to all clients in the chat room notifying them of a
change in the chat user list.

<pre><code>
&lt;system&gt

   &lt;userlist&gt

      &lt;user&gt

         &lt;user_id&gt;&lt;/user_id&gt

         &lt;user_name&gt;&lt;/user_name&gt

      &lt;/user&gt

      &lt;user&gt

         &lt;user_id&gt;&lt;/user_id&gt

         &lt;user_name&gt;&lt;/user_name&gt

      &lt;/user&gt

      ...
      ...
   &lt;/userlist&gt

&lt;/system&gt

</code></pre> After the Java applet client has successfully logged
into the chat room, a list of users currently in the room will be sent
our from the server.

<h4>API</h4>

<p>All chat functionalities accessible from the browser are available
as an API. Providing these API allows different applications to modify
chat without an application-specific user interface.&nbsp;&nbsp; These
API will throw errors if their corresponding PL/SQL statement fail, so
all applications employing them need to 'catch error' to display a
nice error message to the user.  <p><strong><a
href="/api-doc/proc-view?proc=chat%5fmessage%5fpost">chat_message_post</a></strong>
- This API inserts chat message to the database depend whether a chat
room archive mode.  It is also broadcast the message to all Java
clients in the room.

<p><strong><a href="/api-doc/proc-view?proc=chat%5fmessage%5fretrieve">chat_message_retrieve</a></strong>
- This API is only used by the HTML client, and is used each time the HTML
client refreshes. The API does not require database call, messages will be retrieve
from AOL Server cache.
<h3>
VII. Data Model Discussion</h3>

<h4>
Should chat messages constitute a subtype of acs-object?</h4>
We are not implementing individual permissioning on each chat message.
As a result we can avoid unnecessary complexity of subtyping the chat message
type. Chat messages will have their own table.
<h3>
VIII. User Interface</h3>

<h4>
Types of chat we need to support</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Public chat rooms</strong>. These are open to everyone in the
<kbd>users_active</kbd>
view.</li>

<li>
<strong>Private chat rooms</strong>. These are open to people in particular user
parties. We check permissions using permissioning for each room.</li>
</ul>
For either kind of chat room, we should support moderated chat. That is,
in such a scenario a posting doesn't go live until it has been approved
by someone who has the 'chat_room_moderate' privilege in the room.&nbsp;
<p>We want to support one-to-one messages for customer support, so we need
one layer on top of the Chat application to make sure that users can find
an appropriate chat partner. For example, if Bill User says that he needs
support for his Acme widget, the system has to find the least busy authorized
Acme widget support person and start a one-to-one chat session between
Bill and that person.
<p>For public community sites where nothing is being sold or supported,
a publisher might wish to limit the load on the server from all of this
one-to-one chatting.
<h4>
Options for the publisher</h4>
Some options are configurable per-room, e.g.,
<ul>
<li>
Is a room private?</li>

<li>
If so, grant permission to a particular party to enter the room?</li>

<li>
Is a room moderated?</li>

<li>
If so, by whom?</li>

<li>
Should we archive all chat messages in this room?</li>

<li>
Is this room active?</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Options for room administrator</h4>

<ul>
<li>
If this room archives all of its messages, then give a 'create transcript'
option.</li>

<li>
View available transcripts.</li>

<li>
Edit/delete existing transcripts.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Why the HTML version can't autorefresh</h4>
The HTML page cannot have a Refresh header to force a redraw of the page;
if it did, the user would be at risk of losing what he or she was typing
into the post form.
<h3>
IX. Configuration/Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>AppletHeight</strong> - Height of display Java applet.</li>

<li>
<strong>AppletWidth</strong> - Width of display Java applet.</li>

<li>
<strong>ServerPort</strong> - Port will be listen for Java client connection.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
X. Future Improvements/Areas of Likely Change</h3>
A much more stable Applet client interface would be in order. It would
also be nice if we allowed more concurrent applet connections to the server.
