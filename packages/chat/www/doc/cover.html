<h3>
I. The Big Picture:</h3>
The Chat application offers a reliable means by which site members can
initiate and participate in both real-time and moderated discussions. Discussions
can be both public or restricted to people in certain user groups. The
Chat application allows for the archiving and retrieval of these discussions
as well. The Chat application also may be used for one-to-one real-time
browser-based discussions, which can be helpful in a customer service setting.
Unlike ordinary instant messaging systems, this enables a customer service
representative to transmit images to the customer and, if appropriate,
preformatted responses to frequently asked questions. This application
can also serve as a user-to-user instant messaging system, allowing users
to send private messages to each other.
