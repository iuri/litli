	<p>How can I have an even greater impact in my field?

	<p>Peer-exchange between youth development and CTC practitioners is a core component of the Youth Visions model. In the spirit of knowledge sharing between organizations, CTCNet also created a training curriculum and related materials needed to execute a Youth Visions Capacity Building Workshop. Upon completion of your own Youth Visions program, your center can host a Capacity Building Workshop to provide other youth-serving organizations with insider tips on the following:

	<p>
	<li>Infusing community decision-making activities into youth programming, 
	<li>Understanding why media literacy is important for today"s youth, and 
	<li>Learning about the potential of using multimedia to further your organization's mission. 
	
	<p>One of the overriding goals in hosting this capacity building workshop is to share with the greater community opportunities to create and disseminate youth media. The Youth Visions Capacity Building Workshop is not intended to be a showcase of your work. Instead, it is designed to focus on how you can use the knowledge you gained through implementation of your Youth Visions program to train staff from other organizations on building their capacity to integrate multimedia technology training and youth-driven, community-decision making into their programming.
