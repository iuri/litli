"Invisible" hyperlinks have been added to each page so
that you may ask FP2000 to display how the pages
relate to each other.  This was done by putting href
anchors at the bottom of each page, with no text.<br>

By doing so FP2000 believes these are the links between
the pages, even though the true links are executed by
Virtuflex and the "hidden template=" lines on each page.
