Information about Sites
</center>

</font>
<p>
In Webbed-Time Dollars there are three organizing groups:
</p>
<li>Members</li>
<li>Organizations</li>
<li>Sites</li>
</p>
<p>
Participating members can be designated as belonging to an organization.  Organizations can be designated as being responsible for a named sites.
</p>
<p>
The information entered for members and organizations is very similar.  There are minor variations such as the absence of a "home telephone" number for an organization.
</p>
<p>
Site information is reduced further to a name and address.  It could, for example, be a housing project.  And attached to the Site are two connections:
</p>
<li>An Organization</li>
<li>A Manager</li>
The Manager is a Member who is designated as responsible for a named Site.
</p>
<p>
Also, the Site can be designated as Active or Inactive and information is held about when the Site was first entered and when the entry for the Site was last updated.
</p>
<p>
The specific information that is stored for an Organization can be viewed <a href="/cgi-bin/virtuflex.exe?template=td\td-table.htm#site">here</a> (use your Back button in the browser to return here.)&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the same information that can be found by going to the "Quick Tour," Choosing "About Credits and LINCT," and Choosing "Technical Introduction."
