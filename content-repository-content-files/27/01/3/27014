For a launch of the first product by a
start-up company, the medical affairs (MA) team plays both strategic
and operational roles. Launch presents a brand-new and urgent situation
at a company with limited experiences, staff, and budget. A structured
set of processes for analysis, planning, implementation, and follow-up
are cited to assist a start-up in this new endeavor. This article
discusses the why, what, how, when, and by or for whom questions a new
MA department must consider in the launch phase. External audiences for
the company and MA include investigators and customers (providers and
institutions). At a start-up company, the research and marketing
divisions, the internal customers of MA, need bridging for optimal
periapproval strategy. A strategy and plan for MA are required to be
integrated with corporate, product, and research strategies. Many
options for MA exist and will depend on existing people (experiences
and biases), corporate and product strategies, budget, systems
availability, and target audiences. Priorities need to be set among the
many possible <span class="hit">programs</span>, such as phase 4
trials, medical information, publication strategy, formularies,
thought-leader development, and adverse experience reporting. Another
strategic question is whether to outsource, use corporate staff, or
develop corporate alliances to fulfill the responsibilities. Phase 4
research is discussed as a capstone to integrate all the aforementioned
issues.<br>

INTRODUCTION<br>
<br>
The medical affairs (MA) department can assist management and staff
of a start-up company in both research and development (R&amp;D) and
sales and marketing (S&amp;M) with the optimal preparation for launch
of their first product. In this article, MA is defined fairly broadly
to include medical information, medical communications and medical
education (internal and external customers), and phase 4 trials. This
article flows from more general considerations to more specific
information, all regarding start-up companies, product launch, and
medical affairs.<br>
<br>
Five objectives underpin this article:<br>
<br>
1. The launch situation at a start-up company is discussed and is the
main context for this article.<br>
<br>
2. The information, education, and research needed to plan and
complete this first product in the periapproval phase will be addressed.<br>
<br>
3. This article will address five key questions: What has to be
done, why, when, how, and by whom, including strategies, processes, and
operations for MA.<br>
<br>
4. The medical communications and phase 4 trial areas will be used
to elaborate the needs, strategies, processes, and operations for MA
during product launch period at a start-up company.<br>
<br>
5. A package of educational materials, especially in the figures
and tables, will be provided to help educate and prepare the start-up
company staff.<br>
<br>
PRODUCT LAUNCH SITUATION<br>
<br>
An overall context warrants presentation to set the stage for MA
engagement in a start-up pharmaceutical or biotechnology (bio/pharma)
company at launch. The launch phase for a new product usually is
considered the time period from approximately 2 years before to 2 years
after regulatory approval for marketing, also known as the periapproval
period. The company faces various limits and challenges during this
time frame as it prepares for the launch and marketing of the first
product. A start-up company often will have developed a niche product
in terms of therapeutic usage (smaller target patient population and
single indication) and prescriber base (a medical specialty). Excellent
examples are Bexxar&reg; from Coxira for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in
2003,
ReoPro&reg; from Centocor for percutaneous coronary angioplasry in
1994,
and Epogen&reg; from Amgen for anemia of kidney dialysis in 1989. A
single
therapeutic use and a specialty target audience are advantageous to a
new company since they allow for a smaller, more focused S&amp;M
organization, as well as R&amp;D operations, while the company learns
the "ropes" of marketing a product for the first time. However, the
revenue potential can be less, as well.<br>
<br>
Figure 1 lists eight such limits and challenges, which will be
elaborated on further. The challenges of launch mode for planning and
operations include the new work needs of marketing (foreign to the
scientists), the new customers (payers and health providers), new
regulatory requirements (advertising, adverse event reporting), and the
urgent timeline for all work. A start-up bio/pharma company has only
been in existence a relatively short time, as little as 5-10 years. A
lack of resources is common; yet, a high need for such resources
exists, and infrastructure is missing. Expanding staff with a diversity
of new roles starts to meet the evolving new product needs, which
culturally, experientially, and operationally challenge the
organization. All divisions of the company may only employ as few as 50
full-time staff members in the United States or its country of origin.
Two years before launch, the whole S&amp;M division may comprise as few
as six people, including a vice president of the division, a head of
marketing, one product manager, a head of sales, a professional staff
person in MA, and one or two staff support persons. For example, Amgen
had approximately 600 staff with only about 50 S&amp;M people in the
United States around the launch in 1989 of its first product, Epogen,
along with a pipeline of about five lead molecules. In 2003, the
biotechnology world consisted of 4,471 companies worldwide employing
195,820 staff, or an average of 44 people per company (1). External
vendors and consultants are brought in at key milestones to provide the
needed guidance, expertise, and work products, which are added
challenges because outsourcing is used for core roles. Some new
companies may operate in a virtual company mode using external vendors
through most of the prelaunch period in order to conserve their own
resources. The R&amp;D division predominates the staffing in size and
influence, which can undergo a cultural and operational shock when the
company rapidly evolves and adds an S&amp;M operation.<br>
<br>
The experience of staff is usually quite limited, especially with
regard to soon-to-be-marketed products in all divisions, including
R&amp;D and L&amp;R (legal and regulatory), as well as S&amp;M. The
senior management team and board of directors, the decision-making
bodies, may not have had experience in launching a product, with all
its attendant new research and marketing strategies, plans, staffing,
and action items requiring their approval. A viable and consistent
revenue stream for the company may be lacking and poses significant
personal financial risk to new employees who face few retirement
benefits and no guarantee of either first product success or any added
staff and adequate <span class="hit">program</span> funding. Often,
academic-based and younger staff will be the norm, with a sprinkling of
a few entrepreneurially experienced managers.<br>
<br>
Performance expectations at many levels must be dealt with for the
company and its products, and they are predicated on outside
influences, the collective actions and product marketing experience of
the pharmaceutical industry, not just the start-up company. Sources of
expectations for outcomes are manifold:<br>
<br>
1. Future customers (the five "Ps," providers, payers, patients,
principal investigators, and policy makers).<br>
<br>
2. Company management, which is rapidly evolving in composition and
needs as products advance.<br>
<br>
3. Government agencies, as regulatory needs change and expand
dramatically with a marketed product in the offing with promotion,
advertising, sales to physicians and institutions, and phase 4 trials.<br>
<br>
4. Business partners in the R&amp;D and S&amp;M areas with their own
goals, procedures, and culture.<br>
<br>
5. The investment world, which often demands shortterm goal
achievement, milestones, and financial targets over the long term.<br>
<br>
Budgets and resources are quite limited, given that no sales
revenue yet exists. The primary sources of money are prior investments,
venture capital, initial public offering of stock shares, financed
debt, and possibly milestone payments from pharmaceutical partners. In
addition, the burn rate of financial resources may exceed the money in
the bank, as a company tries to ramp up for a product launch. In the
area of biotechnology, Ernst &amp; Young stated that, in the years 2003
and 2004, 31%-40% of companies had only 0-2 years of cash left to cover
expenses at their burn rates (1).<br>
<br>
An existing drug entrenched in the health care system can pose
serious competition for a new product. Furthermore, a fully staffed and
experienced company markets that competitive product. It is hoped the
new product may fill an unmet medical need, be first-in-class, or be
novel among the existing marketed products. The predominant
organizational norm for a new company with a lead product is to have a
corporate pharmaceutical partner as a source for short-term milestone
revenue for operations, although at a sacrifice of revenue from future
sales. The partner can provide expertise for the downstream
organizational needs in clinical development, regulatory affairs,
marketing, sales, and MA. In 2003-2004, more than 800 corporate
alliances existed between new biotechnology companies and large
pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies (2-5). In product examples
previously mentioned, Centocor partnered with Lilly for ReoPro in
cardiology and Corixa partnered with GlaxoSmithKline for Bexxar in
oncology. The potential challenges in such shared arrangements are
substantial, especially with respect to the decision-making process
(who, what, how, when, and why), control issues for work and decisions,
alignment of goals, division of responsibilities, and milestone
reporting. A best practice for the larger partner is to have a
licensing division that specializes in alliances and proactively and
continuously works with the start-up company to minimize such problems.<br>
<br>
Potential operational benefits exist in a start-up company for the
work environment, as represented in Figure 2. Territorialism often is
minimal as groups are small, needs are large, camaraderie is the
behavioral norm, and standard operating procedures (SOPs) are few. The
goal is to get the decisions made and work done by whoever is willing
to take on the responsibility. With few SOPs and preconceived
approaches, along with the high work demands in volume and variety, an
entrepreneurial work environment fits well with this stage of evolution
of the company in its method of operation (a "just do it" mentality).
Out of necessity, decisions are delegated throughout the organization,
less organizational hierarchy exists, and as a result, decisions are
made more rapidly. Communications are more open and candid among the
levels of the start-up organization with fewer people and a less
complex process structure. With high work demands shared by fewer
people, high-energy output is the expectation. As the company grows and
matures, some of these benefits can turn into problems, especially a
lack of guidelines and SOPs. Such a situation can lead separate groups
with overlapping responsibilities within the organization to make
inconsistent decisions based on different sets of criteria and
personnel.<br>
<br>
Success factors for launch of a new product are consistent for all
companies, whether startup or established. Basically, all new products
targeting a therapeutic area are introduced into the health care world
with similar regulatory hurdles, patient care needs, provider
challenges, payer demands, S&amp;M processes, and health care systems.
The outcomes in the periapproval period for a product are considered
predictive of the medical and financial success of the project for its
major indication for the full 5-10 years of patent life after
marketing. Basically, a product launch occurs only once within the
medical community; you have one chance to convince them that the
product meets their patient care needs and should be prescribed. The
acronym COPE4 can be used to describe success factors for what it takes
for product launch by any bio/pharma company, which is outlined in
Table 1. Cope is well defined by Webster's dictionary for this launch
purpose; that is, "fight or contend successfully," "deal with
problems," and "match equally." The fourth power of COPE relates to the
four success factors for a product launch, each of which is defined
further by four specific issues to be dealt with.<br>
<br>
The health care system, especially in the United States, is
complex, especially in judging where and how a product will fit into
therapy for a targeted disease. Start-up companies have focused for
more than 5 years on the research data package in order to obtain
product approval, including safety and efficacy, demonstrated in highly
controlled clinical trials, metabolism and pharmacokinetics,
formulation, and manufacturing. To launch the product and reach the
patient, the company must determine how to navigate the drug through
the multiple and diverse barriers and facilitators in the health care
system. Figure 3 offers a picture of the US health care system and the
many agents who engage in product decisions for patients; these 18
agents are not an exhaustive list but well represent four categories.
Providers (listed in rectangles) care for the patient and make drug
choices, although many of them are also gatekeepers influencing the
decision of the primary provider, a physician. Principal investigators
(PIs) and thought-leaders (TLs) are expert providers with special
influence on their colleagues and institutions. The payers are listed
in diamonds. A payer breakdown for 2002 by the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid (CMS) stated percentage contributions of the health care
dollar were 35% for private insurance, 33% for CMS, 14% for
out-of-pocket patient expenditures, and 12% for other private and
public funding (6). Approximately 15% of the US gross national product
was consumed by health care, and about 10% of the health care dollar is
dedicated to drug purchases. These drug expenditures have been growing
annually at a rate of 10%-15%, resulting in increasing limits by payers
on product availability and reimbursement.<br>
<br>
The value proposition of the approved new drug (the drug's value as
a component of health care delivery) is critical for success of the
launch. Health care companies and institutions (listed in ovals in
Figure 3) are many in number and diverse in organization and roles, all
of which can influence what product is used and when and how. They use
formularies, medication algorithms, guidelines, and authorization
procedures. Examples of these health care organizations are
prescription benefit managers (PBMs), pharmacy and therapeutics
(P&amp;T) committees, health maintenance organizations (HMOs), managed
care organizations (MCOs), compendia (officially recognized books
listing product uses), group purchase organizations (GPOs) of
hospitals, and wholesalers. Government agencies (listed in stars in
Figure 3) regulate what is available, how it can be used, and how it
will be paid for. Examples of these government agencies include the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Office of Inspector General (OIG)
in the Justice Department, and CMS in the Health and Human Services
Department. Business practices in the pharmaceutical areas are also
legislated and regulated as previously described (7-13). Trade
associations engage in writing performance expectations and behaviors
and practices for their member companies.. Various other groups (listed
in pentagons) have a significant <span class="hit">effect</span> on
product availability and usage directly or by pressuring these agencies
and institutions. Various patient support groups promote
disease-specific research and product use; medical and pharmaceutical
societies write guidelines for product use and acceptable bio/pharma
company behavior in relations with their membership. Competitors try to
prevent inroads by a new product.<br>
<br>
THE PROCESS<br>
<br>
In the bio/pharma world, there is only one launch window for a
product and primarily one chance with the provider-customer to convince
them the product will meet their needs safely at a reasonable cost.
Given such an ill-defined situation and the serious launch needs, a
careful and relatively structured process will be required to create
the best-possible vehicle at the best-possible cost for the varied
roads to the desired destinations. The A-S-P-I-R-E&reg; process is one
such
methodology to build the car (the MA unit) to help carry the cargo (a
drug and all accompanying data) through the maze of roads and barriers
(eg, the health care system) to the new destination (the patients with
the targeted disease, the health care institutions, and their
providers). Table 2 lists the six phases of A-S-P-I-R-E, along with key
suggested features for each, which are decribed next. They can be
formulated into a checklist to ensure that all the bases in an
organized method are covered.<br>
<br>
The analysis phase involves collecting data about the company, the
product, the market, and the competition. Table 3 lists the needs for
an MA department at the first stage of analysis. Access to company
management is required as well as all the collaborators with MA,
especially R&amp;D, L&amp;R, and S&amp;M, for existing strategies and
plans. R&amp;D staff access will include the lead clinical person for
clinical trial operations, pharmacokinetics, safety, formulations, and
product development. S&amp;M staff access will include market research,
sales management, and the product manager. Information needs involve
three areas: product, market, and company. Product information includes
the investigator's brochure (IB), proposed package insert, all
publications (preclinical and clinical), and data on file at the
company for unpublished issues such as stability information and new
product profile (ideal and current). Marketing information should
target the disease state profile (main indication and planned secondary
indications if any), the audience (prescriber and gatekeeper profiles
and opinions about the product), and competitive products. Company
information includes organization and lead personnel, any existing
SOPs, and resources (budgets, staffing, systems, and equipment).
Evaluation further necessitates gap analysis as information is being
obtained and plans formulated in order to identify deficiencies of the
product and the company to be rectified. In addition, the standard <span
 class="hit">SWOT</span> analysis should be performed for the product
and company to assist in planning. <span class="hit">SWOT</span>
is an acronym for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
Finally, in this analysis phase of A-S-P-I-R-E, access to the
appropriate expertise will be needed for planning and implementation,
which usually involves consultants and vendors at a leanly operating
start-up company to extend the capabilities of the new MA unit. A new
medical director faces the challenge of making decisions with
insufficient data and experience, as well as planning and
implementation with insufficient analysis or without use of outside
assistance. These decisions are challenging because of their urgency,
budget limits, restricted knowledge based on limited experience, or
simply fear of exposing their own lack of experience. The risk is
inadequate planning and then inadequate <span class="hit">programs</span>,
which lead to less <span class="hit">effective</span>
product and customer support, and which are often only apparent when a
problem occurs down the road. The costs of these risks will be in lost
opportunities for the product and the added costs of reworking or
restaffing to meet the needs of a given situation.<br>
<br>
Strategize and plan are the next two steps in A-S-P-I-R-E, which
can take place only after thorough analysis. The MA strategy is based
on, and must dovetail with, the existing strategies of R&amp;D and
S&amp;M for the company and product. We also must incorporate the
launch situation, budget availability, staff limits of a new company,
the new and novel product with its supportive data, the specific
challenges of the health care system for the target disease,
expectations of management, competition (products and companies), and
any corporate partners. Planning at a start-up company usually is an
entrepreneurial, open, consensus-building, and iterative process. As
part of the collaboration across the start-up company, any new unit
must engage likely collaborators proactively who may not appreciate
their new roles or the need to collaborate. For MA, they broadly
include R&amp;D, S&amp;M, L&amp;R, and manufacturing while they take
the initiative assertively. The planning is iterative to maximize
content (extent and applicability) and especially acceptance and
engagement of others as appropriate. It begins by first seeking input
and ideas in an open-ended fashion, as well as discussing options, and
then formulating straw man proposals, followed by seeking
collaborators' input again on the proposals. Finally, a plan is
formulated with six main components:<br>
<br>
1. Strategies to guide the organization and to integrate with the
company.<br>
<br>
2. Measurable and realistic objectives or outcomes to achieve.<br>
<br>
3. Action items to be accomplished for the objectives, including
deliverables.<br>
<br>
4. Responsibilities identified for the work and time frames in which to
deliver.<br>
<br>
5. Resource requirements.<br>
<br>
6. The measurement level for success.<br>
<br>
The planning phase culminates with senior management approval.<br>
<br>
Implementation is the fourth phase of A-S-P-I-R-E and is not
necessarily a single event or single point in time. The product
approval and launch time frames, as well as budget availability and
management agreement, will dictate the scope and scheduling of <span
 class="hit">programs</span>. Staff will need to be recruited, hired,
and trained. Space must be allocated and designed for staff and <span
 class="hit">programs</span>.
Systems and equipment will need to be obtained and integrated into the
company and department. SOPs and operating guidelines have to be
written for L&amp;R reasons, as well as for consistent operations in
its content and quality. Vendors will need to be screened, audited,
selected, trained, and integrated. The <span class="hit">programs</span>
must be rolled out, based on a necessary phase-in schedule.<br>
<br>
The two follow-up phases of A-S-P-I-R-E, review and edit, should occur
later after the <span class="hit">programs</span> are rolled out. An
overall assessment of the MA department can be done at 6-18 months
after product approval, and specific <span class="hit">program</span>
assessments can be accomplished individually at a prespecified time
after individual rollout dates. For this review phase, the feedback
should be formal and well structured, perhaps surveys from internal
customers, such as S&amp;M staffs, and external customers, the
providers who have used the products and services or <span class="hit">programs</span>.
The departmental plan should have identified specific measurable
outcomes for each <span class="hit">program</span>.
Additionally, a benchmark study could be done to compare the department
and its outcomes to other companies. It should cover at least medical
information, medical education, and phase 4 research <span class="hit">programs</span>.
Publications
based on the research conducted may be one of the desired
outcomes to measure. Metrics on medical information inquiries can be
collected, such as numbers of them, time frames, audiences, outputs,
and satisfaction levels, and then compared with benchmarks.<br>
<br>
The <span class="hit">effect</span> of MA on sales cannot and
should not be measured. MA must establish its independence from
marketing and patient care focus, while supporting the company's
educational and research efforts, in order to maintain its credibility
with customers, investigators, the public, regulators, and the legal
world. The "edit and adjustment" phase could involve modifying existing
<span class="hit">programs</span> or creating whole new ones;
reengineering the process for them; changing staffing, vendor, or
systems resources; or identifying new or different outcomes.<br>
<br>
MEDICAL AFFAIRS<br>
<br>
A discussion of the strategic and operational impact of an MA unit
starts with identifying all the internal customers who will either be
served or be collaborators, overseers, or assistants in producing
optimal operations. Figure 4 presents 10 such departments within a
company, which will work with an MA unit. Four groups identified with
stars in the figure comprise the core areas with which MA will work
most closely to obtain the information, establish relationships, and
meet company outcomes to be successful. Several skills, also listed in
Figure 4, are necessary for MA to create the best plans, obtain the
appropriate information, set up the optimal relationships, and develop
the best <span class="hit">programs</span> for the product, customers,
and company. Communication and collaboration are critical needs for a
unit such as MA, which usually serves in several liaison roles for
various departments of the company, for example, bridging between
R&amp;D and S&amp;M (bringing science to marketing and bringing
marketing to research); serving as the face of the company to customers
for various departments, purveying information to external customers on
behalf of safety, pharmaceutics, and manufacturing departments; and
triaging customers to appropriate internal groups (eg, reporters to
public relations, investors to investor relations, patients with
adverse event to safety, a researcher to the appropriate R&amp;D group,
such as clinical, metabolism, formulations, or preclinical). Consensus
is necessary to foster understanding of the preferences, needs, and
environment of each internal group for a new product and the customers
and then to create the procedures and outcomes that meet internal needs
and customer needs. A contribution to the success of each collaborator
and each department by MA is needed wherein they perceive value,
permitting optimal MA unit functional capacity.<br>
<br>
A start-up company's strategic engagement of MA for the first
product launch can be relatively broad. The extent of this engagement
depends on the organizational needs and desires of key company players
identified and assessed through the A-S-P-I-R-E process, the division
of responsibilities assigned by the senior management team for each
division, and the capabilities of the management, staff in MA, and
consultants. The new laws, regulations, and guidelines of FDA, OIG,
trade associations, and professional societies over the past 5 years,
especially for medical education, customer relationships of physicians
and clinical pharmacists with companies, and research relationships,
have raised the bar for business practices by bio/pharma companies and
have expanded the role and responsibility of MA (7-13).<br>
<br>
Seven strategic issues for MA engagement are listed in Table 4.
First, the investigator profile will be changing dramatically in this
periapproval period, a transition with which the R&amp;D division may
not be entirely familiar. Investigators will become thought-leaders in
the medical community on how this product will enhance therapy and fit
into the health care system. Investigators also will be customers who
will prescribe the product and recommend its use. The number of
investigators will expand and incorporate less experienced researchers
who will perform a significant number of the phases 3 B and 4 trials in
varied and more practical settings and with more typical patients.
Second, the medical needs of the customers related to the primary
indication of the new product need to be identified in three areas:
information, education, and research. The customer pool includes the
five "Ps." This market research process will impact marketing <span
 class="hit">programs</span>
and future research trials. Third, publication planning is a major
strategic driver of the whole company, which must incorporate at least
the product's research (data and needs), marketing needs, and
characteristics of the health care system into one plan, focusing on
the evidence and the promise, two of the four success factors for
launch. It further incorporates the full life cycle of a product, from
the first human trials until the patent life has expired and for both
internal outcomes to guide the research plans and for external outcomes
for medical education of providers and payers. Fourth, marketing plans
are created and rolled out based on the data produced in the company's
studies and the labeling, and they also account for the target disease,
the target providers, other therapies for the disease, and the health
care system. The medical appropriateness and accuracy of the
information being used by the marketing department for product
promotion will need quality assurance from an oversight committee,
which includes representation from MA, regulatory affairs, safety, and
legal when appropriate. Fifth, research needs transition to a new a
phase for the periapproval period with follow-on studies described
subsequently. Sixth, risk assessment must be performed by any company
in at least the areas of marketability risk and adverse events risks.
Proactive plans in risk assessment with potential outcomes and
alternative approaches, along with any necessary SOPs, will need MA to
ensure their medical appropriateness. Finally, a risk assessment and
strategic planning are important to the company's organizational
readiness for product launch and the medical <span class="hit">programs</span>
to support the company and customers. This strategic analysis also can
be incorporated into the A-S-P-I-R-E process for gap and <span
 class="hit">SWOT</span> analyses for plans, staffing, procedures, and <a
 name="bestPart"></a><span class="bestpart">programs</span>.<br>
<br>
The scope of potential services and <span class="hit">programs</span>
to be planned and conducted by MA can be extensive, as suggested in the
launch factors for success (COPE4) and based on the A-S-P-I-R-E
assessments, the target disease, the addressable patients, product
needs, and company strategies and desires. Table 5 outlines possible
informational, educational, or research activities divided into
clinical <span class="hit">programs</span> and marketing support <span
 class="hit">programs</span>,
which are standard in the industry for MA units. They have been well
described in the pharmaceutical literature, especially Drug Information
Association publications (14-30). No start-up company has enough
resources and time to plan and initiate them all, so that priorities
need to be established and <span class="hit">programs</span> rolled
out over time based on needs, resources, and capabilities. Seven <span
 class="hit">programs</span> are suggested in Table 5 (noted by an
asterisk) as the core initial <span class="hit">programs</span>
around product launch, based on their high priority to meet regulatory,
patient care, ethical, and product needs. They comprise a minimum level
of service to maximize a successful product launch for the company and
the health care world.<br>
<br>
THREE KEY STRATEGIC ISSUES<br>
<br>
Further prominent strategic issues for MA at the maturing start-up
company include timelines for the rollout of plans and <span
 class="hit">programs</span>, firewalls that distinguish and separate
MA from S&amp;M activities with customers and regulators, and
outsourcing of <span class="hit">programs</span> to vendors. Strategic
planning for MA <span class="hit">programming</span>
must consider the time frame for its planning and implementation,
especially integrated with the key milestones for the company and
product, such as phase 3 study completion, the dates of major annual
medical meetings of the target audiences, the New Drug
Application/Biologic License Application filing, FDA approval, and
product launch. Figure 5 presents a sample flowchart; it is a complex
chart because it needs to encompasses the five functional areas for MA:
medical information (MI), medical science liaisons (MSL), medical
education (ME), phase 4 or 3 B studies (Ph4), and planning and
operations preparations (P&amp;O). The timeline in this example covers
a 2-year period and is divided (especially before product approval)
into quarters of the year, listing 28 standard and major activities.
These activities have strong interdependencies in content,
relationships, and timing. Hence, structured sequencing needs to be
addressed in the strategic and operational plans, as well as integrated
with the product milestones and the work by R&amp;D, S&amp;M, and
L&amp;R.<br>
<br>
The MA structure requires a variety of firewalls for its
organization and operations within a company to achieve the appropriate
medical focus and operational distinction from marketing. The structure
and processes must establish transparency to customers and offer
bulletproof status for audits by regulatory authorities. Table 6
reviews the protective walls and potential resulting expectations. The
customers (providers), regulatory authorities, and the public at large
expect independent medical and product discussions and decisions.
Accurate information whether published or not and whether positive or
negative for the product is required. Fair balance in any discussions
is needed, regarding, for example, adverse experiences, extent of
efficacy and versus competitive products, and the quality of the data.
Prompt and complete followthrough in the appropriate medical context is
a necessity. Fulfilling all of these four expectations creates
credibility and acceptance of inquiry responses, monographs, formulary
information, and educational <span class="hit">programming</span> from
MA and the company.<br>
<br>
To insulate MA and create the optimal environment in a marketing
and research company, eight suggested protective walls can be employed
(31):<br>
<br>
1. All review processes for the generation of documents and grants
are independent from marketing influence and sales transactions.<br>
<br>
2. The operating procedures, whether SOPs or guidelines, are
spelled out and demonstrate the independence and science focus of MA.<br>
<br>
3. Inquiry requests, adverse event reports (AEs), and product
complaints (PCs), three primary customer interfaces, should be
documented using validated databases for AEs and PCs. Also, all three
customer interfaces should be available as necessary for audits,
thereby demonstrating the transparency of the organization.<br>
<br>
4. Departmental performance objectives should be centered on
productivity and quality of the various medical and patient care
responsibilities, divorced from sales or marketing goals.<br>
<br>
5. Compensation in salary and bonus should be a separate process for MA
from S&amp;M, however realizing that most bonus <span class="hit">programs</span>
have corporate profitability components.<br>
<br>
6. The employees' professional credentials in hiring and promotion
processes should be focused on medical and pharmaceutical training and
experiences.<br>
<br>
7. The annual process for budgets also must be separate from
marketing budgeting, however again realizing that the company budget is
one large pie to be divided among all departments, and it is derived
from sales revenues.<br>
<br>
8. The division's physical location can create an operational
message such that MA should be a distinct area, again separate from the
marketing area.<br>
<br>
Some companies will be very conservative with firewalls and
organizationally place MA within R&amp;D or clinical affairs and not
S&amp;M. However, the conduct of MA as described with the eight
operational practices is the real measure of independence, accuracy,
ethical practice, and credibility.<br>
<br>
A new MA unit at a start-up organization does not possess all the
necessary staff and expertise to plan and to perform all its roles to
support launch and customers. The use of consultants and contract
service organizations (CSO) is a common practice. The CSO is a vendor
with the requisite expertise and resources, who can develop and execute
a plan and the operations with the company to provide the specified
service in a timely fashion. The CSO already has been performing such
services for various established and new companies. Their advantages
are manifold because they have the systems, equipment, SOPs, staff,
industry experience, and service experiences. The CSO can be a
full-service industry provider covering a multitude of R&amp;D and
S&amp;M activities or a specialized MA or medical communications
company. A full-service approach may offer discounted pricing for
greater scope of collaboration at the obvious risk of relying too
heavily on any one organization. The consultant is used as an extension
of the director or vice president of an MA unit to assist with
strategic planning and <span class="hit">program</span> development,
including identifying and evaluating the appropriate CSO(s) for the
company.<br>
<br>
The CSO presents a host of personnel and process challenges to the
new company, as outlined in Table 7. Two overriding issues center on
the <span class="hit">effectiveness</span> of the CSO and its fit with
the company. Ideally, the company should create a checklist of
questions to be addressed in the CSO assessment, incorporating all 21
issues. The personnel issues include the assessment of 10 items. Eleven
issues address processes, a few of which merit added comments. Workflow
and related processes should be addressed, taking into consideration
physical locations within the offices of the CSO and geographic
considerations between the company and CSO. The physical setting of an
operator or a health care professional's office area must be
appropriately private. Triage between the CSO and company is a high
priority for communication systems in a live time frame. Customer
interfaces with the CSO must be varied and flexible, for example, fax,
telephone, letter, and e-mail. A report system will be needed at
multiple levels, quantifying service activities, customer profiles, and
servicequality attributes. A management report addresses service
levels, abandonment rates, response types, CSO worker time reports, and
customer feedback. Competitors to the company must be identified, and
the CSO must ensure that no conflicts of interest and no overlap of
staff or systems exist. A crisis management plan must involve physical
(eg, hurricanes, blizzards, and power outages) and system disasters,
and the backup <span class="hit">programs</span> and recovery systems
to cover data in such eventualities must be identified. Cost plays an
important role because the higher the quality requirements,
functionality, and size of services, the more the potential cost. The
CSO can aid the company in fulfilling areas of company need, especially
system and SOPs, avoiding the company's starting from the beginning.<br>
<br>
<span class="hit">PROGRAM</span> EXAMPLE, PHASE 4 RESEARCH<br>
<br>
To further elucidate the strategic impact and operational fit of MA
for the launch of a new product at a maturing start-up company, the
phase 4 research <span class="hit">program</span> can be addressed in
four areas:<br>
<br>
1. Its strategic fit (the why question)<br>
<br>
2. Differentiated <span class="hit">program</span> traits from
traditional R&amp;D (the how and what questions)<br>
<br>
3. Specific study approaches (the how question) as they differ from
standard R&amp;D<br>
<br>
4. Types of studies (the what question) (27,32,33)<br>
<br>
Tables 8 and 9 address these four issues. Phase 4 trials are now
considered a critical success factor for product launch for several
reasons. Their cost is not inconsequential, estimated to be
collectively about $90 million for a major new product with blockbuster
potential (32,33). The strategy for the phase 4 research <span
 class="hit">program</span> of MA needs to engage the 10 issues in
Table 8. The traits of the phase 4 <span class="hit">program</span>
also listed in Table 8 incorporate a real-world context for this
research. In addition, control of data and publications becomes a
bigger issue, with investigators playing more critical roles in study
design and publication authorship. The major increase in workload
usually necessitates a CSO to carry the bulk of the workload along with
the medical science liaison organization, which is a field-based
science group from MA. Further, although the overall cost over several
years can be tens of millions of dollars, the cost per patient is
reduced by 75% or more in contrast to phase 2/3 trials. Also, the drugs
and clinical testing of patients usually are part of normal patient
care and paid for by the health care system. Phase 4 trials are an
important component of life cycle plans for a product (34,35).<br>
<br>
Five types of study approaches are commonly used, as listed in
Table 9. The types of studies in phase 4 are quite varied, as suggested
by the many representative and common topics in Table 9. The bottom
line for any phase 4 trial <span class="hit">programs</span> and their
role in the launch of a new product by a new company is to fulfill the
needs of five key and required constituencies: the patients, the health
care systems, the providers, the product and company, and the
regulatory authorities.<br>
<br>
SUMMARY<br>
<br>
This article is targeted toward the management of a start-up
company to assist with the optimal preparation for launch of their
first product, particularly the medical affairs engagement. This
article addressed five basic questions (why, what, how, when, by whom)
for the MA group, including strategies, analyses, processes, and
operations with a focus on medical communications and phase 4 trials.
The challenging launch situation was described for a start-up company,
that is, a relatively inexperienced and resourcelimited science-based
company that has great need for development of new plans, services, and
<span class="hit">programs</span> during the urgent product launch
period. Launch success factors were identified (COPE4). Challenges of
new customers and the health care system were presented. A structured
process, A-S-P-I-R-E, was discussed to assist the start-up company
prepare for launch. Medical affairs was discussed for strategy,
customers, needs, and scope of <span class="hit">programs</span> to
meet these special needs. Several important strategic issues were
particularly culled for comment, that is, a strategic timeline for
services from medical affairs during launch, firewalls for MA, and
outsourcing needs at a start-up. Phase 4 <span class="hit">programs</span>
were especially identified for product launch for a new company. The
reader is referred to the references provided for more comprehensive
discussions of the related topics.<br>
